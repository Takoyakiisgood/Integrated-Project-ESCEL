          <p>Welcome aboard fellow Keyboard Warrior! The land of Animalia has been taken over by evil Robot Monsters, these scheming monsters have stolen many pet eggs from Animalia... <span class="help-highlight"
            >Be that hero that Animalia needs</span> and rescue it from the demonic hands of the Robot Monsters!</p>
          <ul id="inst-list">
            <li>Select <span class="help-highlight">Adventure mode</span> from the "Play" tab on the navigation bar to play.</li>
            <li>In Adventure mode, there are <span class="help-highlight">3 rounds of typing</span> you need to clear in order to defeat the monster.</li>
            <li>The <span class="help-highlight">difficulty of the sentence generated</span> would be based on your level. (Easy: level 15 and below, Medium: level 30 and below, Hard: above level 30)<br>
            NOTE: sentence generated for guests would be of difficulty easy, so be sure to register for an account if you want to challenge yourself!</li>
            <li>You will <span class="help-highlight">start off with 100 HP</span> and HP would be deducted throughout the 3 rounds if typing errors are made. (1 error = -1 HP)</li>
            <li>When your <span class="help-highlight">HP falls to 0</span>, you lose! But fret not, you won't lose anything other than not being able to gain EXP/Eggs.</li>
            <li>At the end of each round you'll be alerted of your <span class="help-highlight">Words Per Minute(WPM)</span>. So if you're a competitive try to top the leaderboard with the fastest WPM!</li>
            <li>When you defeat a Monster, the monster has a 20% chance of dropping a <span class="help-highlight">pet egg</span>. Pet eggs are then added into your inventory under the "Home" tab, you can grow the eggs by clicking on the "Grow!" button which would appear when you hover over an egg. To fully evolve a pet, simply play 5 games after clicking the "Grow!" button. Fully evolved pets can be stored and viewed in your inventory.</li>
            <li>When you defeat a Monster, you gain 5 EXP. At level 1, you will need 15 EXP to <span class="help-highlight">level up</span>, and an additional 5 EXP each time you level up. (E.g. level 2: 20 EXP, level 3: 25 EXP etc.)</li>
